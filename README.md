Situational Setup (Project 1: Establish a Corporation &amp; Project 2: Install DIA)
Introduction:

It is the year 2024. You have a great idea for a product that you know will become a success. You have decided to start this company. You will begin small with yourself as the only employee working from your home. It MUST be a physical product that is manufactured and not just a service.

For this assignment, you are to give your company a name and you are to describe what the product is. This cannot be a real or existing company (with the ONLY exception being if it is an actual company that you started on your own prior to taking this course).

This product can be anything. It can be hand painted bow ties. The product can be scented candles or even framed pictures of your customer superimposed next to their favorite movie star. The only requirement is that the product requires some physical parts that will necessitate raw material coming in and a finished product being delivered.

VERY IMPORTANT: It MUST be a product you can make or do on your own in your house. So this excludes making a new electric automobile or sneakers or a new cell phone. It must realistically be a product a person could actually produce. You will lose marks if the TA determines it is unrealistic that the product you choose could be made by a single person working out of their home.

You MUST to do an internet search (Google or Ask or Yahoo, etc.) to ensure the company name does not already exist. This is very important.

Throughout this course, your company will grow in size and sales. As your company grows, so will your Information Systems.

Future assignments for CS 1032 will contain questions about your expanding needs based on material we will be covering in class. These questions will include not only your decisions, but how and/or why you made them.

首先写出你的公司的名字然后是公司的地址

最后是你的公司是干什么的

You are to submit an MS Word document with the following:

Information:

1.) COMPANY NAME:

note:

– you must ensure the company does not actually exist, even if it is a company you never heard of before.

(example: do a quick search on the web. If you wanted to call your company ‘Working Bytes’ check to make sure a company by that name does not already exist.)

2.) COMPANY LOCATION: _____________________________________________________

note:

the physical location of the company (city and province/state and country). must be a real location (on this planet).

3.) COMPANY FUNCTION/PRODUCT_____________________________________________

note:

what does the company make?

think of what kind of company you would actually want to start. It has to be a ‘manufacturing company’ that makes a product.

the information must be detailed enough to provide a clear understanding of the functionality and operations of the company.

Execution:

Write this information inside an MS Word document.

Place your name, followed by the company name at the top.

Fill in the required information after.

At the end of the document, include your name, Student number and Western ID (the first part of your Western email (i.e. istude123)

Formatting is not important as long as the document is easy to follow:

The document should look something as simple as the example on the following page:

Kenny Doitte

Mxyzptlk Inc.

1.) Mxyzptlk Inc.

2.) London, Ontario Canada

3.) This company makes and sells specialized wearable plastic pins created from photographs supplied by the customer. The plastic pin is created using a MakerBot® 3-D Printer. The plastic pin is then painted to match the photograph and then delivered to the customer through a carrier delivery service.

Submission Instructions:

You must upload and submit, via the CS1032 OWL Web Site, the following one (1) file:

See the instructions on Submitting Assignments.

DO NOT submit or upload to the Dropbox Section of OWL.

youraccountname_companyname_A1.docx or youraccountname_companyname_A1.doc

(example: assume my UWO email is kdoit373@uwo.ca

So, my account name is: kdoit373 and my company is the Niblick company.

so, my file name that is to be used for submission is:

kdoit373 _Niblick_A1.docx

-or-

kdoit373 _Niblick_A1.doc

(.doc –or- .docx Depends on which version of MS Office I am using)

It is the student’s responsibility to ensure the work was submitted and posted in OWL.

OWL replies with a summation verification email (every time).

Any assignment not submitted correctly will not be graded.

NOTE: This MUST be a MS Word document. You can NOT submit an Apple .pages file or any other word processor file. Only an MS Word document will be graded. All other file types will receive a zero (0) grade for this assignment.

It is the student’s responsibility to check that the correct work was uploaded to OWL.

If you do not get a grade for the assignment and it turns out when you look, there was nothing there because you did not submit it correctly, then you will receive a zero (0) for the assignment.

For future assignments, if a student states they submitted the assignment, but for some reason it is not on OWL, they will then be required to forward the original acknowledgement email from OWL stating the assignment was submitted. If the student cannot provide this email, then it will be assumed the student did not submit, or did not submit correctly, their assignment and it will be considered as not submitted. They will receive a zero (0) for the assignment.
